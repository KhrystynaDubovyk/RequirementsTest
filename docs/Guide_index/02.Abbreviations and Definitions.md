| Data Identifier (DID)       | Addressed memory locations of the ECU.                                |
| Diagnostic Trouble Code     | In the automotive industry, codes that are prescribed by SAE standards to help track problems in a vehicle detected by its on-board computer                                                                   |
| JSON                        | Is a lightweight data-interchange format. It is easy for humans to read and write. It is easy for machines to parse and generate.<br>- Is a text format that is completely language independent but uses conventions that are familiar to programmers of the C-family of languages.|
| GPS                         | The Global Positioning System – is a space-based satellite navigation system that provides location (using not less than four satellites simultaneously) and time information to anyone who exploits GPS receiver. When installed in a car, a GPS unit can provide useful information about the car's position and the best travel routes to a given destination.|
|E911 override                | Occurs in case of a car accident – when the airbag deploys or, in certain vehicles, the emergency fuel pump shutoff is activated. The vehicle system (in case of relevant version) should react in appropriate way [3] when this override happens.|
| VR                          | Voice recognition is the technology by which sounds, words or phrases spoken by humans are converted into electrical signals and these signals are transformed into coding patterns to which meaning has been assigned.<br>Relating to automotive, voice recognition aims to enable drivers to control entertainment and navigation systems simply by using their voices. |
| Command                     | This is an option that a user can select either via voice recognition (VR) or through the on-screen menu during a user-initiated interaction.|
